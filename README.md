*Notes:*
* Logical Registers (ALU Registers): Actual registers appearing within instruction fields
    * Physical Registers : Locations in the actual hardware register file
    * Mapping the logical level to the Physical 
    * ROB == Active list
    * a completed or an incompleted instruction that remains on the reorder buffer 
      must be aborted if it follows an exception or a mispredict branch  
    * 33 logical (1-31 plus hi and lo) and 64 physical integer registers
    * 32 logical (0-31) and 64 physical floating point registers 
    * register map table: unit that maps logical to physical registers
        - 16 read ports (4 instructions x 4 registers)
    * Integer AND FP free lists contain list of currently unassigned physical registers
